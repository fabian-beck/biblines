Pre-final version of a biblines. 26.08 - last update.

I. INTERACTION:
1. When you hower on some keywors (in bold) - it eigher highlites (with yellow) smth on (both) sparkline and timeline, or shows overlaying bars on a big timeline.
2. When you hover on a sparkline - it overlays on the timeline.
3. When you click on a sparkline - it stays on a timeline (becomes a "base", so to say).
4. When you hover on bars on a timeline - the corresponding years and number of publications are shown as a tooltip.
5. When you hover on a keyword - it gets highlighted with gray color.
6. When you hover on a sparkline - corresponding sentence is highlighted with gray color. 
7.
8. When you hover on a key word or a sparkline that draws additional barchart on a timeline (above base), secon element of the legend appears.


To Do (??)
1. Nice arrows on tooltips.
2. Blue highlighting of the sentences instead of the gray (??).
3. Think about coloring of the bars (still should stay in a grayscale).

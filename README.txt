I. INTERACTION:
1. When you hower on some keywors (in bold) - it eigher highlites (with yellow) smth on (both) sparkline and timeline, or shows overlaying bars on a big timeline.
2. When you hover on a sparkline - it overlays on the timeline.
3. When you click on a sparkline - it stays on a timeline (becomes a "base", so to say).
4. When you hover on bars on a timeline - the corresponding years and number of publications are shown as a tooltip.
5. When you hover on a keyword - it gets highlighted with gray color.
6. When you hover on a sparkline - corresponding sentence is highlighted with gray color. 
7. There is a legend, which changes if the base changes.
8. When you hover on a key word or a sparkline that draws additional barchart on a timeline (above base), secon element of the legend appears.


To Do (??)
